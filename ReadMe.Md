# **ZuriNet**

_An AI-powered platform to identify and alert users about high-risk areas for Gender-Based Violence in South Africa._

## **Overview**

ZuriNet is designed to enhance personal safety and awareness for users, especially women, by identifying and alerting them when they are in or near areas with a history of Gender-Based Violence (GBV) incidents.

The application is going to be using the data below to train advanced **machine learning models**:

- Licensed crime data
- Public news reports
- Verified community submissions

By combining multiple trusted data sources, the system detects **high-risk "Red Zones"** and provides **real-time alerts** to users.
