This High Court judgment concerns an urgent application brought by Zodwa Pretty Zuma (Applicant) against the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality and its Municipal Manager (Respondents) regarding the unlawful disconnection of her electricity supply.

**Background:**
*   On February 19, 2024, the Respondents disconnected the Applicant's electricity supply, allegedly due to tampering with the electricity meter.
*   The Applicant sought urgent interim relief, and on February 29, 2024, the court ordered the Respondents to reconnect her electricity within four hours, while directing the Applicant to continue paying current service fees (a "rule nisi").
*   The matter returned to court for a final decision on confirming this interim order.

**Key Issues Decided by the Court:**
1.  **Mootness:** The Respondents argued the application had become moot because the Applicant signed an Instalment Plan Agreement on December 10, 2024, allegedly admitting to tampering and agreeing to pay arrears including tampering charges.
    *   **Court's Finding on Mootness:** The court found the application was *not* moot. The Instalment Plan Agreement referred to an *earlier alleged tampering* on December 6, 2023, not the February 19, 2024 incident central to this case. Furthermore, the Applicant had signed this agreement under duress (to get electricity during the festive season due to a faulty meter) and the Respondents' own evidence (an inspection card) contradicted the claim of tampering on December 6, 2023.
2.  **Lawfulness of the Disconnection:** The Respondents contended their actions were lawful under Section 26(2) of the Electricity By-Laws, which permits immediate disconnection without notice if prima facie evidence of tampering exists.
    *   **Court's Finding on Lawfulness:** The court found the Respondents failed to provide prima facie evidence of tampering on February 19, 2024.
        *   The Respondents provided only one undated, unauthenticated photograph, with no confirmatory affidavits from the officials who took it or inspected the meter, and no job card or inspection letter for that date.
        *   In contrast, the Applicant provided an independent electrician's affidavit and photographic evidence, concluding that the meter's crimped lock was intact, indicating no tampering.
        *   The Respondents did not refute this expert evidence.
        *   The court reiterated that the evidentiary burden to prove tampering rested on the Respondents.

**Conclusion and Order:**
The court concluded that no prima facie evidence was produced to confirm tampering by the Applicant, and therefore, the disconnection of electricity by the Respondents on February 19, 2024, was unlawful.

The court issued the following order:
*   The rule nisi issued on February 29, 2024 (ordering reconnection) is confirmed.
*   The Respondents are interdicted from charging the Applicant a reconnection fee for this unlawful disconnection.
*   The Respondents must pay the Applicant's legal costs on an attorney and client scale, including counsel's fees.
