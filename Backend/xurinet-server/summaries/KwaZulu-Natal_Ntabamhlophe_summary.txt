This is a High Court appeal case concerning **Menzi Emmanuel Mondli Dlamini (Appellant)** against **The State (Respondent)** regarding the severity of sentences.

The appellant was originally convicted in the Estcourt Regional Court on three charges related to a crime committed in September 2014:
1.  **Housebreaking with intent to rape and rape:** 8 years imprisonment.
2.  **Murder of Ms. N[...] M[...] (59 years old):** Life imprisonment.
3.  **Rape of Ms. N[...] M[...]**: Life imprisonment.

The appeal specifically challenged only the two life imprisonment sentences for murder and rape.

**Key Facts & Evidence:**
*   The victim, Ms. M[...], was 59, lived alone, and was murdered in her home. Her home was forcibly opened, and she was raped before being strangled to death (evidenced by a fractured hyoid bone).
*   DNA evidence (appellant's blood on a cloth on the bed and semen found in the victim's vagina) linked the appellant to the crime.
*   The appellant's defense at trial, claiming a secret relationship with the victim and attributing scratches on his neck to an unrelated attack, was rejected as "absurd" and "concocted." The appellant ultimately did not challenge his convictions on appeal.

**Legal Argument Regarding Rape Sentence:**
*   The court addressed whether the rape charge qualified for a minimum sentence of life imprisonment under the Criminal Law Amendment Act. The appellant's defense argued that it might not if the murder occurred *after* the rape was completed, suggesting the grievous bodily harm was not "involved" in the rape itself.
*   The High Court, citing *S v September*, confirmed that if a victim is murdered "either during or after the commission of the rape," life imprisonment is applicable for both offenses. Therefore, the regional magistrate was correct in imposing life imprisonment for the rape.

**Appellant's Submissions on Sentence (and the Court's Rejection):**
*   The appellant argued the sentences were "grossly inappropriate," "induced a sense of shock," and were disproportionate.
*   He also contended that his prospects for rehabilitation should have been considered, citing his age (33 at conviction).
*   The court dismissed these arguments, stating:
    *   An appeal court only interferes with sentences in cases of serious misdirection.
    *   Age is not a reliable predictor of future conduct; the appellant had previous suspended convictions for robbery (2008) and housebreaking (2009), indicating a pattern of criminal behavior.
    *   Murder and rape are profoundly serious crimes, and the legislature mandates minimum sentences of life imprisonment unless "substantial and compelling circumstances" are demonstrated.
    *   The appellant's personal circumstances (age, father of three) were deemed insufficient to constitute "substantial and compelling circumstances" to deviate from the prescribed minimum sentences.
    *   Pre-trial custody (just over a year) could not reduce a mandatory life sentence without compelling circumstances.
*   The court found the regional magistrate had properly and thoroughly considered all relevant sentencing factors.

**Order of the High Court:**
1.  The appellant's appeals against the life imprisonment sentences for murder and rape are **dismissed**. The sentences themselves (their length) stand.
2.  However, in terms of s 280(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act, it is explicitly ordered that the life sentences for murder and rape **shall be served concurrently** with each other. (This clarification was made by the High Court to avoid ambiguity, as the regional magistrate had not specified).

In essence, the High Court upheld the life sentences for murder and rape, finding no misdirection by the lower court, but clarified that these two life sentences will run at the same time.
