This document is a judgment from the High Court of South Africa regarding an appeal by **Menzi Emmanuel Mondli Dlamini** against two sentences of life imprisonment for murder and rape.

**Background:**
Dlamini had been convicted in the Estcourt Regional Court of housebreaking with intent to rape and rape, murder, and rape. He received sentences of eight years for housebreaking and life imprisonment for both the murder and rape charges. The appeal was specifically against the life sentences for murder and rape.

**Factual Landscape:**
The victim, 59-year-old Ms N[...] M[...], was found raped and strangled to death in her home in September 2014. DNA evidence, including Dlamini's blood and semen found at the crime scene and in the victim, unequivocally linked him to the crimes. Dlamini's defence, alleging a secret relationship with the victim and an attack by unknown men to explain his injuries, was deemed "absurd" and rightly rejected by the regional magistrate. On appeal, Dlamini conceded his conviction on the murder and rape charges.

**Legal Issues and Arguments:**
1.  **Applicability of Life Sentence for Rape:** The court addressed whether the rape charge attracted a minimum sentence of life imprisonment, specifically if the murder (strangulation) constituted "grievous bodily harm" involved in the rape. Reviewing conflicting case law, the court confirmed that if a rape victim is murdered during or after the commission of the rape, life imprisonment is an available sentencing option for both offences.
2.  **Appellant's Submissions on Sentence:** Dlamini argued that the life sentences were "grossly inappropriate" and "induced a sense of shock." His counsel suggested that his age (33 at conviction) offered prospects of rehabilitation and that his personal circumstances (father of three) should cumulatively be considered "substantial and compelling circumstances" to deviate from the prescribed minimum sentences.
3.  **Court's Response:** The High Court dismissed Dlamini's arguments. It noted his prior convictions for robbery (2008) and housebreaking (2009) demonstrated a "trend" of criminal behaviour, making his age an unreliable predictor of future conduct. The court emphasized the extreme seriousness and heinous nature of murder (depriving a precious life) and rape (invading dignity, humiliating and degrading), asserting that such crimes warrant severe sentences as mandated by the legislature. It found no "substantial and compelling circumstances" to justify a departure from the minimum life sentences.
4.  **Concurrency of Sentences:** Although the regional magistrate did not specify, the High Court ordered that the two life sentences for murder and rape should run concurrently with each other, in line with the Correctional Services Act for life sentences.

**Conclusion:**
The High Court found that the sentences were not inappropriate or shocking, given the brutal nature of the crimes and Dlamini's utter disrespect for the victim. The appeal against the severity of the life sentences was therefore dismissed.

**Order:**
The appellant's appeals against the life sentences for murder and rape were dismissed, but it was ordered that these two life sentences would be served concurrently.
