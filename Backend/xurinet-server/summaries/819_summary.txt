This High Court of South Africa case involved A Million Up Investments 86 (Pty) Ltd (Plaintiff) suing Mavambo Coaches (Pty) Ltd (Defendant) after the consolidation of two actions.

The dispute originated from the Defendant's alleged unlawful occupation of the Plaintiff's commercial premises at 1[...] V[...] Road, Johannesburg, following the expiry of an oral lease agreement on 31 December 2019. The initial action sought commercial eviction, while the second claimed damages for unlawful occupation.

However, the eviction claim became academic as the Defendant abandoned the premises in November 2024. The Plaintiff thus pursued three remaining claims:
1.  **Lost rental income** due to unlawful occupation and inability to lease the property, including an additional "PXL portion" encroached upon by the Defendant.
2.  **Damages for the cost of restoring the property**, which was found to be in a dilapidated state due to the Defendant's failure to maintain it and extensive vandalism.
3.  **Unpaid municipal service charges, rates, and associated interest** owed to the City of Johannesburg.

At trial, the Defendant and its attorneys failed to appear, leading the Plaintiff to proceed under Uniform Rule of Court 39(1) to prove its claims. The Plaintiff presented evidence from a property valuator (who assessed market rental value), the property managing agent (who testified on the property's condition before and after occupation and municipal charges), and a quantity surveyor (who costed the necessary repairs).

The court found in favour of the Plaintiff on all claims, ordering the Defendant to pay:
*   **R13,030,814.00** for lost rental (Claim A).
*   **R13,657,915.93** for restoration costs (Claim B).
*   **R2,670,609.08** for municipal sub-charges and rates (Claim C).

Interest at 11% per annum from 29 October 2020, and costs on scale C, were also awarded.
