This document details the sentencing of Stanley Kibi Bakili in the High Court of South Africa, Free State Division, Bloemfontein, delivered on 18 September 2025.

**Key points:**

*   **Accused:** Stanley Kibi Bakili
*   **Convictions:** Bakili was convicted of multiple serious offenses, including:
    *   Murder (planned and premeditated, committed by a group acting in common purpose)
    *   Extortion
    *   Money laundering
    *   Unlawful possession of a prohibited firearm
    *   Unlawful possession of ammunition
    *   Defeating the administration of justice
*   **Sentences:**
    *   **Murder:** Life imprisonment (as per the prescribed minimum sentence for such a crime).
    *   **Extortion:** 15 years imprisonment.
    *   **Money laundering:** 15 years imprisonment.
    *   **Possession of prohibited firearm:** 20 years imprisonment.
    *   **Possession of ammunition:** 5 years imprisonment.
    *   **Defeating the administration of justice:** 5 years imprisonment.
*   **Aggravating Factors:**
    *   The murder was a **planned contract killing** driven by pure greed. Bakili hired a hitman (Mr Mbebetho) for R100,000 (which he allegedly never paid), provided the weapon and vehicle, and lured the deceased to a trap.
    *   Bakili extorted over **R5 million** from the deceased, primarily to finance his gambling habit, and arranged the murder when the deceased began to suspect him and refused to pay more.
    *   His previous convictions for theft, falsely pretending to be a police officer, and six counts of fraud demonstrated a pattern of dishonesty.
    *   The court found a **lack of remorse** on Bakili's part.
*   **Mitigating Factors (considered but not found sufficient to deviate from minimum sentences):**
    *   Bakili is 44 years old, a divorced father of 5-6 children (who lost his primary care while in custody), and his 64-65-year-old mother was dependent on him.
    *   He was self-employed with an income of R50,000/month and supported community members and children's university fees.
    *   He claimed to suffer from depression, PTSD (exacerbated by incarceration), hypertension, and a skin disease developed in custody.
    *   He spent over seven years in custody awaiting the finalization of the trial.
*   **Court's Reasoning for Not Deviating from Minimum Sentences:**
    *   The court acknowledged the time spent in custody but noted that a significant portion of the delays was attributable to Bakili's own actions, such as frequently changing legal representation (seven times) and requesting postponements.
    *   The gravity and callous, brazen, and merciless nature of the crimes, particularly the contract killing, outweighed the mitigating circumstances.
    *   No "substantial and compelling circumstances" were found to justify a departure from the minimum sentences prescribed by law.
