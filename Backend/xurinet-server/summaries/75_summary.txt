This document details the sentencing judgment delivered by Justice Jolwana in the High Court of South Africa, Eastern Cape Division: Mthatha, for the case of **The State vs Thobilizwi Maqam (Case No. CC22/2025)**.

Thobilizwi Maqam was convicted of six offences, predominantly involving the rape of three young women, one of whom was 15 years old and another whose rape involved grievous bodily harm. The State invoked provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 105 of 1997, meaning Maqam faced potential life imprisonment for two rapes and a minimum of 15 years for the third.

The court emphasized the extreme seriousness of the rapes, describing them as humiliating, degrading, and brutal invasions of privacy, dignity, and person. It highlighted that Maqam carefully planned these attacks, targeting vulnerable victims (e.g., a 15-year-old living with an elderly great-grandmother, a woman alone at home, another walking alone in a secluded area). He was always armed with a knife or sword and covered his face with a balaclava, which prevented identification and delayed solving the crimes for about 10 years.

**Victim Impact:**
*   **S[...]**: Suffered constant fear, emotional turmoil, and resorted to heavy drinking. She was pregnant at the time of the rape, and her boyfriend initially doubted paternity. Her great-grandmother and her experienced significant changes to their sense of safety, unable to sleep with lights off. She felt misunderstood by her community for not screaming.
*   **S[...]2**: Was in Grade 12 when raped, failed that year, and lost 5 years of schooling due to public whispers and trauma. She eventually graduated from university but left a job due to anxiety. Her sleeping patterns were severely disrupted, and she mourned losing her virginity through rape, against her personal decision.
*   **A[...]**: Refused to testify in aggravation, having suffered panic attacks during the trial and avoiding eye contact with Maqam. She was shocked to learn Maqam, whom she knew from her locality, was her attacker.

**Accused's Mitigation and Lack of Remorse:**
Maqam presented his personal circumstances, including a difficult upbringing, dropping out of school, supporting his family, and having two very young children with an unemployed foreign national partner. He requested a lenient sentence to return to his children. However, the court found his apology to be disingenuous, offered only *because* he was convicted. He maintained his innocence even after conviction, offering implausible explanations for his DNA being found at the crime scenes. The court found "not even a whiff of remorse" and no "substantial and compelling circumstances" to depart from the prescribed minimum sentences.

**Victim Support and Secondary Traumatisation:**
The judgment also critically addressed the lack of support for victims. S[...]2's counseling was discontinued due to a lack of funds for travel, and victims struggled to get witness fees. The court lauded the investigating officer, Warrant Officer Dlomo, for his dedication and sensitivity in assisting victims. A social worker, Mrs. Nozibusiso Sukani, was called to court and undertook to provide ongoing counseling to the victims. The court condemned the "lackadaisical attitude" of relevant officials, which caused "avoidable secondary traumatisation," and directed that the judgment be sent to department heads for corrective action. It also commended the victims for their courage and resilience in fighting a "lonely fight."

**The Sentence:**
Thobilizwi Maqam was sentenced as follows:
*   **Counts 1 & 2 (Housebreaking):** 3 years imprisonment each.
*   **Count 3 (Kidnapping S[...]):** 5 years imprisonment.
    *   Counts 1 and 2 are to run concurrently with Count 3, making an effective 5 years for these offences.
*   **Count 4 (Rape of S[...]): LIFE IMPRISONMENT.**
*   **Count 5 (Rape of S[...]2): LIFE IMPRISONMENT.**
*   **Count 6 (Rape of A[...]): 15 years imprisonment.**
Additionally, Maqam's particulars must be entered into the National Register for Sex Offenders and the National Child Protection Register, and he is declared unsuitable to work with children.
