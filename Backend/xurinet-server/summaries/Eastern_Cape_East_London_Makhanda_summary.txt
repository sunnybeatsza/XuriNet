This document is a judgment from the High Court of South Africa (Eastern Cape Division, Makhanda, Circuit Court, East London) in the case of The State versus Vusumzi Dukumbana.

The accused, Vusumzi Dukumbana, appeared on charges of **kidnapping** and **rape** (in contravention of Section 3 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 32 of 2007). He pleaded not guilty to both counts.

**The Accused's Version:**
Dukumbana claimed he had a love relationship with the complainant (ZM) and denied kidnapping or raping her. He stated she willingly accompanied him home after he confronted her about missing money, and there was no sexual intercourse. He alleged a mutual fight occurred at his home where she assaulted him with a hammer, and her anal injuries were self-inflicted.

**The Complainant's Version:**
ZM testified that on January 4, 2024, the accused forcefully entered her yard, beat her, and dragged her from her home, despite her unwillingness. He continued to assault her on the way to his home, accusing her of having an affair. At his home, he interrogated, tortured, and coerced her into confessing to affairs, subjecting her to further beatings, throttling, and threats with a knife. He then forcefully penetrated her vagina and subsequently her anal orifice (lubricating with cooking oil). She was bleeding and in pain. She escaped when he fell asleep and sought help from neighbours, who observed her distraught and injured state.

**Key Evidence and Court's Findings:**
*   **Corroboration:** The complainant's sister-in-law (NM) corroborated the initial assault and dragging. Neighbours (AN and SB) confirmed her distressed and injured state post-incident, and SB confirmed the rape report.
*   **Forensic Nurse:** Ms. Nomvuyo Makinana, a forensic nurse, documented multiple physical injuries (laceration on lip, bruises, abrasions, swelling) and significant anal injuries (redness, lacerations). She found no fresh vaginal injuries but noted healed hymen tears. She attributed injuries to blunt force and strangulation. Crucially, she found no traces of alcohol or drugs in the complainant, contradicting the accused's claim of her intoxication.
*   **Credibility:** The court found the complainant a credible and reliable witness.
*   **Accused's Improbabilities:** The court found the accused's version "marred by a series of improbabilities, fabrications and contradictions," specifically:
    *   His claim of the complainant's intoxication was disproven by the forensic report.
    *   His claim of a mutual fight and her physical strength was deemed illogical given the initial dragging.
    *   His inconsistent account of hammer blows.
    *   His assertion of "self-inflicted" anal injuries was an afterthought, not put to witnesses, and highly improbable.
*   **Grievous Bodily Harm:** The court, referencing case law, concluded that the complainant's injuries were "actually serious" and therefore constituted grievous bodily harm.
*   **Multiple Rapes:** The court determined that the accused's actions constituted more than one instance of rape due to both vaginal and anal penetration, aligning with the definition of sexual penetration under SORMA.

**Verdict:**
The court found the accused, Vusumzi Dukumbana, **guilty** as charged on both:
*   **Count 1: Kidnapping**
*   **Count 2: Rape** (involving the infliction of grievous bodily harm).
