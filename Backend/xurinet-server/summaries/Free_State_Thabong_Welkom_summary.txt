The High Court of South Africa, Free State Division, dismissed an appeal by Lereko Joseph Moroke against the sentences he received for assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (3 years imprisonment) and rape (life imprisonment).

Moroke was found guilty in the Magistrates Court of assaulting the complainant, M[...] M[...], with clenched fists and a chain, causing grievous bodily harm (Count 1), and raping her multiple times (Count 2). The rape conviction carried a prescribed minimum sentence of life imprisonment due to the nature of the offence, involving a domestic relationship and the infliction of grievous bodily harm on the 19-year-old complainant.

Moroke appealed the sentences, arguing they were "shockingly harsh and severe" and that the magistrate erred by not giving sufficient weight to his personal circumstances, such as his youth (22 at the time of the offence, 29 at sentencing), having a minor child, being raised by a single mother, and a previous conviction for housebreaking dating back to 2012. He contended these amounted to "substantial and compelling circumstances" justifying a deviation from the prescribed minimum sentence.

The High Court reiterated that an appellate court can only interfere with a sentence if the trial court's discretion was not judicially exercised, meaning there was a misdirection or the sentence was disturbingly inappropriate. Crucially, the Court found that Moroke had demonstrated **no remorse** throughout the trial. He consistently maintained his innocence regarding the extent of the assault, denied owning a chain used to strangle the complainant, and claimed the sexual intercourse was consensual, even presenting a witness to try and discredit the complainant.

The Court emphasized the severity of the rape and assault, highlighting the complainant's severe physical and emotional trauma, the betrayal of trust in a former romantic relationship, and the broader context of gender-based violence in South Africa. The Court concluded that the personal circumstances raised by Moroke were traditional mitigating factors that the trial court had already considered. They did not cumulatively amount to "substantial and compelling circumstances" that would warrant deviating from the statutorily mandated life imprisonment for rape.

Finding no misdirection on the part of the magistrate and determining that the sentences were not disproportionate or inappropriate, the High Court dismissed Moroke's appeal.
