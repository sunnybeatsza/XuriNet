This document summarizes a High Court appeal in the case of **Lereko Joseph Moroke v The State**, focusing on the sentence imposed for criminal convictions.

**Key Points:**

*   **Original Convictions and Sentences:** The appellant, Lereko Joseph Moroke, was convicted in a Magistrate's Court on two counts:
    1.  **Assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm:** Sentenced to 3 years imprisonment.
    2.  **Rape:** Sentenced to life imprisonment. This sentence was mandatory under Section 51(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 105 of 1997, due to the complainant being in a domestic relationship with the accused and the infliction of grievous bodily harm.
    The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.

*   **Basis of Appeal:** Moroke appealed against the sentences, arguing they were "shockingly harsh and severe" and that the trial magistrate erred by not giving enough consideration to his personal circumstances. He contended that his circumstances (youth at the time of the offence (22), single father, raised by mother, an old previous conviction for housebreaking in 2012, and being released on bail) amounted to "substantial and compelling circumstances" that should have justified a deviation from the prescribed minimum sentence of life imprisonment for rape.

*   **High Court's Decision:** The High Court **dismissed the appeal** against the sentence.

*   **Reasoning:** The court found no misdirection by the trial magistrate and determined that the sentences imposed were not "disturbingly inappropriate." It held that:
    *   The appellant's personal circumstances, while noted, did **not** collectively qualify as "substantial and compelling circumstances" warranting a deviation from the statutory minimum sentence, especially given the seriousness of the crimes.
    *   The court emphasized the severe nature of the offences: multiple rapes of a 19-year-old complainant, aggravated by a domestic relationship and severe physical assault (including being hit with clenched fists, strangled with a chain, and beaten with a smaller chain).
    *   The appellant demonstrated a significant **lack of remorse**, maintaining his innocence, downplaying the assault, denying ownership of a chain used in the assault, and even attempting to discredit the complainant's testimony through contradictory witness statements.
    *   The court stressed the profound and lasting impact of such violence on victims and the societal interest in combating gender-based violence, which is endemic in South Africa.
    *   The trial magistrate had properly balanced the interests of society, the seriousness of the crime, and the personal circumstances of the appellant.
