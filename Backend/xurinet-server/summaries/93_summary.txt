This document is a **sentencing judgment** from the High Court of South Africa (Northern Cape Division, Kimberley) in the case of **The State v Butiki Simon Maboitshege (KS21/2024)**.

Key points:

*   **Accused:** Butiki Simon Maboitshege
*   **Conviction:** Found guilty of murder on 03 September 2025.
*   **Prescribed Minimum Sentence:** For this type of murder (read with Section 51(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 105 of 1997), the prescribed minimum sentence is life imprisonment.
*   **Final Sentence:** The accused was sentenced to **20 (twenty) years imprisonment** on 08 September 2025.
*   **Reasoning for Deviation from Minimum Sentence:** The judge, Groenewaldt AJ, found "substantial and compelling reasons" to deviate from the prescribed life imprisonment, based on the *S v Zinn* triad (personal circumstances of the accused, the crime itself, and the interests of society) and other legal precedents.
    *   **Accused's Personal Circumstances:** 41 years old, Grade 6 education, employed as a builder supporting his family and parents, one minor child with the deceased, and a minor previous conviction (possession of dagga 17 years prior) making him effectively a first offender for a serious crime. The court viewed him as a candidate for rehabilitation.
    *   **Nature of the Crime:** The murder was not pre-planned, occurred in an "emotionally charged atmosphere," provocation by the deceased played a role, and alcohol was a factor. It was considered a "spur of the moment event."
    *   **Interests of Society:** The death of the deceased (who had four children, including one with the accused) severely impacted her family and the children, depriving them of parental care. Society expects courts to impose sentences that deter gender-based violence.
    *   **Conclusion:** Balancing these factors, including the 19 months the accused had already spent in custody, the court determined that life imprisonment would be "inappropriate" and "unjust."
