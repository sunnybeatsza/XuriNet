This document is a judgment from the High Court of South Africa (Northern Cape Division, Kimberley) regarding the appeal of Stefaans Dickson against his conviction and life sentence for the rape of an 11-year-old boy (referred to as GK).

**Key Points:**

*   **Original Conviction & Sentence:** Stefaans Dickson was convicted on August 5, 2024, of one count of rape (anal sexual penetration) of GK, which occurred on January 12, 2019. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on December 12, 2024.
*   **Grounds for Appeal:** Dickson appealed on two main grounds:
    1.  The trial court erred in finding GK and his grandmother credible, as their oral evidence deviated from their written statements.
    2.  The life imprisonment sentence was shockingly inappropriate.
*   **State's Evidence:** The State's case relied on GK's testimony, corroborated by his grandmother (who discovered the incident), an uncle, medical evidence (fresh anal tears, strangulation marks, trauma), and DNA analysis (Dickson's DNA found on GK's underwear).
*   **Appellant's Defence:** Dickson maintained a bare denial and presented an alibi, claiming he was elsewhere at the time. He suggested his DNA on the underwear could have been from wiping himself after consensual sex with his girlfriend.
*   **Court's Decision on Conviction:** The High Court dismissed the appeal against conviction. It found GK's evidence to be unequivocal and materially satisfactory, corroborated by medical and DNA evidence. The minor contradictions were deemed inconsequential or explained. Dickson's alibi was rejected as inconsistent, poorly presented, and contradicted by the DNA evidence.
*   **Court's Decision on Sentence:** The High Court also dismissed the appeal against sentence. It noted that life imprisonment is the prescribed minimum sentence for the rape of a minor in terms of the Criminal Law Amendment Act. The Court considered Dickson's personal circumstances (age, single, no children, employed, education, nearly five years in pre-trial custody) but found no "substantial and compelling circumstances" to justify a deviation from the mandatory sentence, especially given his prior convictions for murder and rape. The Court emphasized the severe and abhorrent nature of child rape.

**Outcome:** The appeal against both the conviction and sentence was dismissed.
