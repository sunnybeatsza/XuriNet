This document is a judgment from the Labour Court of South Africa.

**Key Points:**

*   **Parties:** Assmang (Pty) Ltd t/a Black Rock Mine (Applicant, employer) sought to review an arbitration award involving Moses Moyo (First Respondent, employee), the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), and the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) and its Commissioner (Third Respondent).
*   **Original Dispute:** Mr. Moyo, a Logistics Supervisor, was dismissed by Assmang for a "serious breach of rules and gross dereliction of duty." He had left a critical "Gate Release Booklet" (used for transporting materials through security gates) unsecured. An attempted theft of wooden poles occurred using a gate release from his booklet, although the theft was ultimately prevented by security.
*   **CCMA Arbitration Award:** The Commissioner found Mr. Moyo's dismissal substantively unfair. While acknowledging his negligence in securing the booklet, the Commissioner reasoned that it was his first offence, no actual loss occurred, and there was no proven direct link to the syndicate or breakdown of trust. The Commissioner ordered Mr. Moyo's retrospective reinstatement and directed Assmang to impose a less severe sanction.
*   **Assmang's Application for Review:** Assmang argued the Commissioner misconstrued the misconduct as mere negligence instead of gross dereliction of duty, and that he focused on irrelevant factors (like absence of loss) while ignoring the seriousness of the breach, the erosion of trust, and Mr. Moyo's lack of remorse.
*   **Labour Court's Decision:** The Labour Court found the Commissioner's award to be unreasonable.
    *   It concluded that Mr. Moyo's actions amounted to a deliberate decision to leave the booklet unsecured, which constituted at least *gross negligence*, if not gross dereliction of duty, given the importance of the security rules.
    *   The Court emphasized that the *risk* posed by the breach, not the actual loss (which was averted by security), was the critical factor in assessing the fairness of dismissal, especially in a high-risk mining environment.
    *   The Court also found Mr. Moyo's alleged "admission of negligence" was not genuine remorse, as he attempted to deflect responsibility.
    *   The Court held that the Commissioner's reasoning contained material errors that distorted the outcome, particularly by downplaying the seriousness of the breach in a position of trust.
*   **Outcome:** The Labour Court reviewed and set aside the CCMA arbitration award. It substituted the order, declaring that **the dismissal of Mr. Moyo was fair.** No costs were awarded.
