This High Court judgment concerns a claim by A[...] S[...] B[...] (first plaintiff) and B[...] B[...] (second plaintiff) against the Road Accident Fund (RAF) for damages arising from a motor vehicle collision on 27 July 2018. The second plaintiff, who was 15 years old at the time, sustained severe bodily injuries, including diffuse traumatic brain injury, a severe pelvic injury, and spinal injuries.

The case addressed several heads of damages:

1.  **General Damages:** The parties reached an agreement, with the RAF paying R1,000,000.00 to the plaintiffs for the second plaintiff's general damages.
2.  **Future Hospital and Medical Expenses:** The RAF also provided an undertaking in terms of Section 17(4)(a) of the Road Accident Fund Act to cover 100% of these future costs.
3.  **Past Hospital and Medical Expenses:** The RAF denied liability for these expenses (totaling R452,236.85), arguing they had already been paid by the first plaintiff's medical aid scheme (Discovery Health). The court, however, ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, citing established legal precedent (Discovery Health (Pty) Ltd v Road Accident Fund and Another and Van Tonder v Road Accident Fund) which holds that the RAF's statutory duty to compensate for past medical expenses is not discharged by payments made by a private medical insurer.
4.  **Loss of Future Income/Earning Capacity:** The RAF conceded liability for this claim but disputed the quantum, specifically the contingency deductions to be applied. The plaintiffs presented extensive expert evidence from various specialists (neurosurgeon, orthopaedic surgeon, neuropsychologist, occupational therapist, industrial psychologist, etc.). These experts detailed the severe and permanent impact of the injuries, including significant long-term cognitive and psychological difficulties, physical limitations (e.g., restricted to sedentary work, 11mm leg shortening, inability to deliver children normally, ongoing pain), and a reduced life expectancy or early retirement risk. The court accepted the plaintiffs' proposed contingency deductions (20% for uninjured earnings and a higher 50% for injured earnings) due to the extensive and permanent nature of the second plaintiff's injuries and their impact on her employability and earning potential. The court awarded R1,210,830.00 for this claim.

The RAF did not appoint any experts or lead evidence to counter the plaintiffs' claims.

**In summary, the High Court found largely in favor of the plaintiffs, ordering the RAF to pay:**

*   **R1,000,000.00** for general damages (by agreement).
*   **R452,236.85** for past hospital and medical expenses.
*   **R1,210,830.00** for loss of future income/earning capacity.
*   To provide a **Section 17(4)(a) undertaking** for 100% of future medical expenses.
*   To pay the plaintiffs' **legal costs**, including expert fees.

The total amount awarded by the court (excluding general damages agreed upon) was R1,663,066.85.
