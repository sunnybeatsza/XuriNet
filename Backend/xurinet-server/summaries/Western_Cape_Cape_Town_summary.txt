Khanyile Ramba (the Appellant) appealed his conviction and sentence of life imprisonment for the premeditated murder of his girlfriend, S[...] M[...], in the High Court of South Africa (Western Cape Division).

**Background:**
The Appellant was charged with murder, rape, and malicious damage to property. He pleaded guilty to murder, but argued it was not premeditated (seeking application of section 51(2) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act). The State, however, alleged premeditated murder (section 51(1)) and did not accept his plea, recording his admissions.

The Appellant's version was that on 10 September 2021, he confronted the deceased about his stolen property, leading to an altercation. He claimed the deceased and her friends assaulted him. Later, at his house, after he tried to fix a broken door and the deceased slapped him, he hit her several times on the head and body with a hammer. He then left her lying on the floor, went to sleep, and found her unresponsive the next morning.

The State presented evidence from a pathologist, Dr. Louise Marie Kruger, who found widespread blunt force trauma to the deceased's head, body, and extremities, including a traumatic brain injury as the cause of death. Crucially, Dr. Kruger also found "significant trauma to the vulva and the vaginal canal" and anus, which she opined was indicative of resistance and could have been caused by a hammer, all inflicted within the same period before death. An eyewitness, Zine Mankankela, testified about prior assaults by the Appellant on the deceased on the night of the murder, including him slapping her and dragging her, and later returning with a hammer.

**Grounds for Appeal:**
The Appellant argued the trial court erred in finding the murder was premeditated (thus applying s.51(1) CLAA) and in imposing life imprisonment. He contended that his personal circumstances (age 26, first offender, guilty plea, alleged remorse, role of alcohol, and over two years spent awaiting trial) constituted substantial and compelling circumstances warranting a lesser sentence.

**High Court's Decision:**
The High Court dismissed the appeal for both conviction and sentence.

1.  **Conviction (Premeditation):** The court found the trial court correctly concluded the murder was premeditated. It noted that premeditation does not require long planning and that the Appellant's actions—such as fetching a hammer, the calculated nature of the blows (initially to the head, then body), and the severe, widespread injuries including the "significant trauma" to the genitals described by the pathologist—demonstrated a "thought process" and not an instantaneous act of retaliation. The court found the eyewitness testimony to be reliable and consistent with other proved facts.
2.  **Sentence (Life Imprisonment):** The court upheld the life imprisonment, finding no material misdirection by the trial court and no substantial and compelling circumstances to deviate from the prescribed minimum sentence for premeditated murder. While acknowledging the Appellant's age, first offender status, and awaiting-trial period, the court was not convinced of his genuine remorse. It noted inconsistencies between his plea explanation and his later testimony, concluding he "trivialized his conduct" and presented a "watered-down version" of events. The court stressed the heinous and brutal nature of the crime committed against his girlfriend.

Therefore, the appeal in respect of conviction and sentence was dismissed.
